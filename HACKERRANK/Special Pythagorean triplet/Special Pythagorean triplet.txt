A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a<b<c, for which,
a^2+b^2=c^2
For example, 3^2+4^2=9+16=25=5^2

Given N, Check if there exists any Pythagorean triplet for which  a+b+c=N
Find maximum possible value of abc among all such Pythagorean triplets, If there is no such Pythagorean triplet print  -1.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer T i.e. number of test cases. 
The next T lines will contain an integer N.

Constraints
1<=T<=3000
1<=N<=3000
Output Format

Print the value corresponding to each test case in separate lines.

Sample Input 0

2
12
4
Sample Output 0

60
-1
Explanation 0

For N=12, we have a triplet {3,4,5}, whose product is 60.
For N=4, we don't have any pythagorean triple.
