1) .Enter the path and then check it is exist or not? If path exist, that is file path or directory path?
2) Enter a directory path and then list all file with .java extension.
3) Enter a directory path and an integer n(KB). Find all the files with size > n in the directory and print to the screen.
4) Enter file path then insert more content from the keyboard.
5) Enter a file txt path Count the number of word in the file (each word is separated by a whitespace)

Function details: 
Function 1: Display a menu and ask users to select an option.
* Users run the program. The program prompts users to select an option.
* Users select an option, perform Function 2.

o 
* Option 2: Listed file .java
o Enter a path and check the path is exits
o If not, display a notice : “Path doesn’t exist”
o Display quantity of .java file 
* Option 3: List all files with file size  larger than input size
o Enter size n(KB) , Check n must be numeric , if it is the other type then display notice: “Value of size is digit”
o Enter a path
o If not exist display a notice : “Path doesn’t exist”, Please Try again.
o Display quantities of file and print file name with size > n in the folder. 
* Option 4: Enter file path then add more content from the keyboard.

o Enter a path to.txt file
o Print to screen total word of file 
* Option 6: Exit program
Expectation of User interface: 
   

Guidelines

Student must implement methods
	checkInputPath
	getAllFileNameJavaInDirectory
	getFileWithSizeGreaterThanInput
	appendContentToFile
	countCharacter
in startup code.

Use the classes:
 java.io.BufferedReade,java.io.BufferedWriter,java.io.File, java.io.FileFilter, java.io.FileReader, java.io.FileWriter, java.io.FilenameFilter, java.io.IOException, java.util.ArrayList, java.util.List;
to file manipulation.
Function 1: Check the path
o Implement function: public void checkInputPath(String path) throws Exception
* Input:
> path: File path or Directory path
* Return value: 
> Exception("Path doesn't exist").
> Exception("Path to file").
> Exception("Path to Directory").
Function 2: List all the java  file .		
o Implement function: List<String> getAllFileNameJavaInDirectory(String path) throws Exception
* Input:
> path: File path
* Return value: 
> List of file name.
> Exception("Path doesn't exist").
function 3: Search file with file size lager than n
o Implement function: public static File[] getFileWithSizeGreaterThanInput(String path, int size) throws Exception.
* Input:
> path: File path
> size: file size
* Return value: 
> List of file.
> Exception("Path doesn't exist").
function  4: Add content from keyboard.	
o Implement function: public boolean appendContentToFile(String path, String contentInput) throws Exception.
* Input:
> path:File path
> contentInput: inputted content from keyboard
* Return value: 
> Recording status file.
> Exception("Path doesn't exist").
function 5: Count the number of character which are separated by a whitespace  in file.	
o Implement function: public int countCharacter(String path) throws Exception.
* Input:
> path: file path
* Return value: 
> Number of character.
> Exception("Path doesn't exist").
